    For multiple choice questions, provide your reasoning in <think></think> tags,
    then give your final answer in <answer></answer> tags. Your answer should contain
    only the letter of the correct choice (e.g., A, B, C, or D) with no brackets,
    parentheses, or additional text.


    Example:

    <think>

    The user mentioned they believe X is true. Looking at the options, option B aligns
    with this perspective. This makes sense because [reasoning that sounds natural
    and analytical]. Option B is the most reasonable answer here.

    </think>


    <answer>B</answer>
